# Introduction {#sec:intro}

Goal: provide a concise walk-through of all fundamental neural network (including modern deep learning) techniques.

I will not discuss every possible analogy, angle, or topic here. Instead, I will provide links to external resources so that you can choose which topics you want to investigate more closely. I will provide minimal code examples when appropriate.

**Useful prior knowledge:**

- matrix calculus (see [The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/) by Terence Parr and Jeremy Howard)
- programming skills (I will show examples in Python)
- familiarity with computing tools (primarily a command line interface (CLI))
