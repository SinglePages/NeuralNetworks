# Single Neuron

When our model is a single neuron we can only produce a single output. So, $n_y=1$ for this section.

## Notation and Diagram

A diagram representing a single neuron (as we'll see later, a neural network often refers to many of these neurons interconnected):

![](img/Neuron.svg)

The diagram represents the following equations:

\begin{align}
z^{(i)} &= \sum_{k=1}^{n_x} w_k x_k^{(i)} + b\\
a^{(i)} &= g(z^{(i)})
\end{align}

The main points of this equation:

- $x_k^{(i)}$ are the input features for the $i^{th}$ example (e.g., temperature)
- $z^{(i)}$ is a linear combination of the input features
- $w_k$ (weights) and $b$ (bias) are the **learned** parameters (notice the lack of any superscript)
- $a^{(i)}$ is the output of a non-linear activation function $g(\mathord{\cdot})$ applied to $z^{(i)}$
- $\hat y^{(i)}$ is the label we often give to the output ($a^{(i)} = \hat y^{(i)}$)

**For this model, we want to find parameters $w_k$ and $b$ such that the neuron outputs $\hat y^{(i)} \approx y$ for any input.** Before we discuss optimization we should take a moment to code up this single neuron model.

## Code for Computing a Neuron's Output

This code does not containing any "learning" (i.e., optimization), but it is worth showing just how simple it is to write a single neuron from scratch. Nearly all code is used to create random input data.

In the example, we have random parameters and we ignore the output. But what if we want to train the neuron so that the output mimics a real function or process? The next subsection tackles this very problem.

## Optimization with Batch Gradient Descent

You may have noticed that in the previous code listing I also introduced a specific activation function (aka squashing function) called `sigmoid` (aka the logistic function). In this section we'

Do this first

**Deeper dive:** TODO: something on activation functions.

## Input Normalization

I provided *reasonable* ranges for values in the previous code example. For example, temperature values on Earth are typically in the range $[-20, 40]$ Â°C and illuminance in the range $[0, 1e6]$ Lux.

An NN can work with with values in these ranges, but it makes learning easier when you first scale values into the same range, typically $[-1, 1]$. TODO: why?

## The Role of an Activation Function

- hidden neurons
    + default to relu
    + try/create others to solve/investigate specific issues
- output neurons
    + default to sigmoid for binary classification
    + default to softmax for multi-class classification
    + default to no activation for regression
